Sass compiled using the extension for VS code "live sass compiler".

All the rest is static and quite easy to understand. 

We have an index.html, some "ring fenced" css compiled through the sass extension and some vanilla "ring fenced" javascript at the end of the index.html file. Using a very specific naming convention for the CSS and JS to avoid the Wordpress website interacting with this diagram and vice versa.

NOTE: Ringfence all vars before release
